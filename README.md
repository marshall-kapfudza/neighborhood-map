# [Project 5 - Neighborhood Map](http://responsive.co.za)

This is a Single Page App that starts with a prepopulated list of resturants, bars, cafe's, etc. around Cape Town, SA.  

## Quick start
Three quick start options are available:
* download the zipfile on Github, navigate to that folder, and click on index.html
* Clone the repo: `git clone git://github.com/twbs/bootstrap.git.`

## About App
The user can search for other places by keyword (food shops, fast food, etc.) or for a specific place.  The list and markers will update on search with information on all places within the search area. Click on an item in the list to view more information from the Foursquare API such as Name, Phone Number, and Twitter handle. The user can also filter the list by the separate text box in the top left
